Fixed Category Filtering for Arabic Slugs
Problem
Posts in categories with Arabic slugs (like "التنظيف" for cleaning) were not appearing when navigating to category-specific pages (e.g., /blog/التنظيف), but they appeared correctly on the main blog page showing all articles.

Root Cause
When Arabic or other non-ASCII characters are used in URLs, browsers automatically URL-encode them. For example:

Original slug: "التنظيف"
URL-encoded: "%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%B8%D9%8A%D9%81"
The category slug from the URL was being passed directly to the Sanity query without decoding, so it was trying to match "%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%B8%D9%8A%D9%81" instead of "التنظيف".

Solution
Added decodeURIComponent() to decode the URL-encoded category slug before using it in:

1. Sanity Query Parameter
const decodedCategorySlug = decodeURIComponent(categorySlug);
client.fetch(POSTS_BY_CATEGORY_QUERY, { categorySlug: decodedCategorySlug })
2. Category Lookup
const currentCategory = categories.find(
  (c) => c.slug.current === decodedCategorySlug,
);
3. Active Category Highlighting
className={`... ${
  decodedCategorySlug === category.slug.current
    ? "bg-primary-600 text-white shadow-md"
    : "bg-white text-gray-600 hover:bg-gray-100"
}`}
Changes Made
page.tsx
Added URL decoding in the useEffect hook before fetching data
Updated currentCategory lookup to use decoded slug
Updated active category comparison to use decoded slug
Added debug logging to track encoded vs decoded values
Verification
✅ The GROQ query works correctly in Sanity Vision with the decoded slug ✅ Posts now appear when navigating to category pages with Arabic slugs ✅ The correct category is highlighted in the navigation ✅ Debug logs show both encoded and decoded values for troubleshooting

Testing
To verify the fix works:

Navigate to a category page with an Arabic slug (e.g., /blog/التنظيف)
Verify posts in that category are displayed
Check the browser console to see the decoded slug being used
Verify the category button is highlighted correctly
